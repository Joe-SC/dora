# DORA: Data Oriented Risk Assessments

In this project the VERIS dataset is used to devise a framework for data driven Cyber Security risk assessments using several machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to build several machine learning models able to predict Cyber Incident related outcomes that an organisation might care about in performing Risk Assessments.
Secondary to that is the application of several techniques for machine learning interpretability, that would allow an organisation to better understand their model instead of treating it like a black box.
